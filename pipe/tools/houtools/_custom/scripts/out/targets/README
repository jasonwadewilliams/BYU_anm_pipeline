This directory contains renderer specific target scripts.  Currently,
these scripts are only used by RIB renderers.

The environment variable HOUDINI_DEFAULT_RIB_TARGET is used to choose which
RIB renderer is the desired target.

When a RIB output driver is created, the script run is:
    ribcreate_$HOUDINI_DEFAULT_RIB_TARGET.cmd
